# DC-DC Boost Converter using Arduino
This project aims to implement a DC-DC boost converter using an Arduino microcontroller. The boost converter is a type of power converter that is commonly used to increase the voltage of a DC power source. The project uses an Arduino board as the controller to regulate the output voltage of the boost converter.
